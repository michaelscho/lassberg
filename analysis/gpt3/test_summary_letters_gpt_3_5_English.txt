Joseph von Laßberg writes to Johan Adam Pupikofer, informing him about a catalog from Frau Hofrátin von Thaleppe in Stockach, which Pupikofer may find interesting. He asks Pupikofer to return the catalog to him within eight days, as the owner has given him the authority to determine prices. Laßberg also mentions the book Ida von Tokenburg, which he returns to Pupikofer with little gratitude towards the author, who has turned a beautiful romantic story into a ridiculous tale. Laßberg expresses his desire for Pupikofer to visit him in the future, as he misses their friendship and hopes that the distance between them will not be a hindrance. He concludes the letter by asking Pupikofer to pass on his thanks to H. Praes. Scherb along with the enclosed materials.

He also offers to help Pupikofer obtain some books, but warns that some may be missing from his collection. Laßberg shares news of gifts he has received from Wilh. Grimm, including a manuscript of the Rolandslied with accompanying illustrations. He also received two books from Jacob Grimm and Dahlmann, telling their stories of being exiled from their homeland.

Laßberg signs off with greetings to Pupikofer's family and an invitation to visit him.
In a letter dated May 18, 1838, Joseph von Laßberg wrote to his friend Johan Adam Pupikofer expressing his concern about his inclusion in the upcoming publication of "Ritterburgen der Schweiz," a work on Swiss castles. Laßberg did not want too much focus on his biographical details, and he was also unsure about how to handle the cataloging of his collection of manuscripts and antiquities in Eppishausen, which he would soon be leaving. He suggested that the article on Eppishausen should be handled purely from a historical perspective and not delve into recent times. Laßberg also mentioned that he was grateful for the few Swiss friends who would remember him after he left the country. Laßberg concluded by asking Pupikofer if he still wanted the full catalog of his collection, which he had promised to provide, or if he could be excused from completing it.

He mentions that he will be receiving a visit from a Lieutenant from Neuburg and will be occupied with that for a few days.

Laßberg had hoped to work with him and combine their book collections. Laßberg sends his regards to Pupikofer and asks him to greet Scherbs and Imhoff on his behalf. He signs off by wishing Pupikofer a happy future and signs the letter as "Jv. Laßberg."
Joseph von Laßberg sends Hormayr's writings back to Johan Adam Pupikofer, having found the genealogies of the Rhätian, Istrian and Thurgauian counts, as well as the derivation of the Müllinen or Heceliscell lords. He also found interesting information on the history of German songs, such as Wirnt von Gravenberg, Heinrich von Sonnenberg, and the Meranian heroes. Pupikofer expresses his desire to visit Laßberg and discuss the French Alexandreis, but is unable to due to rheumatism. He hopes that the ora pro nobis in the litany will bring relief. Pupikofer requests Laßberg to send him more volumes of Hormayr's writings to ease his troubled soul. He signs off, hoping that they will both be relieved of their ailments soon.
Joseph von Laßberg and Johan Adam Pupikofer corresponded in 1828. Von Laßberg had hoped to deliver some books to Pupikofer himself, but his rheumatism had returned, and there was no snow for him to use the sleigh. Pupikofer had found some information on an Ottonic coin and a family called Zingenbar in the archives. He also requested more of Hormayr's works and mentioned some papers he had written about Thurgovia and Dießenhofen. He requested that List inform him if von Laßberg would be home in the upcoming week, as he wanted to say goodbye before von Laßberg left. Pupikofer also mentioned that his family sends their greetings.

Laßberg also mentions his recent visit to St. Gallen, where he obtained Schinzen's contributions, which he believes have some interesting content. He also suggests that the Anelago and Andilag mentioned by Grimm could refer to investiture, as the German word for clothing is "anlegen". Laßberg regrets not having access to Haltaus and Ducange and mentions that Morikofer will soon send the German Marschalken Urkunde. He ends the letter by wishing Pupikofer's household warmth and requesting his continued kindness.
Joseph von Laßberg expresses sympathy to Johan Adam Pupikofer for the death of his Schneehuhn bird, which he had hoped to serve as a delicacy. Laßberg laments that instead of being eaten by a knowledgeable palate, the bird was likely judged by a mere potato and veal eater. He also mentions the difficulties of finding time to visit Pupikofer, as he is busy with other tasks. Pupikofer responds by thanking Laßberg for his sympathy and invites him to a New Year's Eve dinner at his castle, as well as a soup dinner on the day of St. Bertholdus. He also wishes Laßberg a prosperous new year and hopes to continue visiting him often.
